Huawei has now released its high-profile Mate 30 Series phones onto the Chinese market and it has gone on sale for 40% less than the international prices published on launch. This has unsurprisingly led to stellar early sales. The company is relying on its domestic market to offset softening international sales for the devices, which will ship without the usual Google software and services that customers outside China expect.
